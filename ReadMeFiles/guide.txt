How to properly run:
javac *.java && java GameServer
javac *.java && java FrameViewer
javac *.java && java FrameViewer

This will start the server and two opponents to face eachother. You can run FrameViewer more times
if you would like to test more than two clients

Command line arguments:
First one is for the IP address, second is for the port
If left blank they will automatically go to 'localhost' and '2018' respectively

Starting:
The game will give you the option of selecting 3 difficulties, easy, medium and hard.
The difficulties affect the amount of points, speed, comet probability and pellet probabilities of
the game.
There is also a Get high scores button which will list the top 3 high scores on that server.

Controls:
left and right arrow keys control your ship. try to avoid the comets! the multi color tiny orbs
are called pellets and will make your ship invincible from comets for a short amount of time
(they also give you a points boost)
Once the player hits a comet, the client stops and waits for the other client to finish.
This is when the server tells the clients who scored the most points and who the victor is!
Space key will shoot a bullet which if connects with a comet, will destroy and remove it.
The player is only allowed one bullet on screen at a time to deter the player from spam clicking
space bar, and puts an emphasis on dodging the comets instead
